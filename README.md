## What this module does
Proof of concept test module that allows various ingame UI elements to be toggled on and off without requiring GPK modding. Now also allows changing of character window things like changing your name, laurel, class, etc.



More to come.

## How to use
Requires [Bad GUI](https://github.com/codeagon/badGui/) to function, make sure you have it installed before complaining to me that it doesn't work. 

Install the module like normal and type `gc` into proxy chat.
